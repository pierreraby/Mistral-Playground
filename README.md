# Mistral AI Playground

My 2 cents Mistral AI playground in plain javascript using Mistral clientJS first version.
Deliberately naive for simplicity's sake, but functional.  
**Edit 12/2024**: There was no Mistral chat or playground when this little side project was launched for purely practical purposes.

Next step: register backend-less threads with indexedDB (coming soon).  
**Edit 12/2024** : Make a V2 version and rewrite everything in TS with the new API and add new features like vision and image generation.

Clone the repository and install dependencies with your favorite packages manager :
```
pnpm install
```

Run the dev script for use :

```
pnpm dev
```
